  "Weaves any-tag into any text"

Weaves html tags (or really anything) into a text at given
opening or closing positions. Inserted tags need to be aligned
(that is non-overlapping) in order to be inserted.

Opening and closing tags are inserted and kept in order.

TextWeaver is a library by the LogiLogi Foundation, extracted from
http://www.logilogi.org (http://foundation.logilogi.org).

== Usage

First require it.

  $ irb

  > require 'rubygems'
  > require 'textweaver'

You can create a TextWeaver with any text.

  > w = TextWeaver.new("abcde")

Then add some openings and closings.

  > w.add_opening(1, "(")
  > w.add_closing(4, ")")

  > w.weave 
  => "a(bcd)e"

Possibly with additionally some different tag-types.

  > w.next_set

  > w.add_opening(1, "<")
  > w.add_closing(4, ">")

  > w.weave 
  => "a(<bcd>)e"
